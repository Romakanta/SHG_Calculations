# SHG_Calculations
This contains a step-by-step procedure for calculating the nonlinear optical properties of 2D materials using the ABINIT package (https://www.abinit.org/). When using ABINIT, please cite the relevant papers.
There is a PDF file explaining every step of the calculations from scratch. IN addition, there are multiple directories within the zip file. 
optcell_0 - relax calculations
optcell_3 - relax calculations
band - band structure calculations
shg - second harmonic generation calculations.
